# TODO
- [ ] Games do not consider guild spam restrictions
- [ ] Add a way to get the Super Drill
- [ ] Minions (expensive, mine sludge for you, their inventories can fill up)
  (Minions do not have a physical inventory, it is calculated based on time since started)
- [ ] Add levels to the Mine that have different rewards / items and enemies (unlockable with keys)
- [ ] Improve the inventory system and add new items (maybe also rework the super drill into an item?)
- [ ] Add more mine events (more enemies and other things?)
- [ ] Server setting to set if mine messages are displayed to all or ephemeral or make them all ephemeral without a setting
- [ ] Rework the sludge monster fight to be more skill based rather than luck based
- [ ] Super nanners?
